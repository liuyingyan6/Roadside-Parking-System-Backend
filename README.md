# Roadside Parking Management System

The Roadside Parking Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to manage parking on city streets using magnetic sensors and handheld PDA devices. This system consists of three main components: an Operational Management System, a User-Side Mini-App, and an Inspector's Mini-App.

## Project Overview

As urban areas face increasing parking demands, the Roadside Parking Management System aims to efficiently manage roadside parking by providing real-time information to users, enabling seamless payment processing, and optimizing enforcement tasks for inspectors.

## Features

### Operational Management System

- **Revenue Tracking:** Monitor revenue generated from parking fees and track financial performance.
- **Parking Space Management:** Manage available parking spaces and allocate resources effectively.
- **Order Handling:** Process and manage parking orders generated by users.

### User-Side Mini-App

- **Registration:** Users can register and create accounts to access the parking system.
- **Payment Processing:** Facilitate payments for parking fees through the mini-app.
- **Parking Spot Locator:** Display available parking spots on a map for users to find and reserve.

### Inspector's Mini-App

- **Overstay Notifications:** Receive notifications for vehicles overstaying in parking spots without creating orders.
- **Feedback Photo Upload:** Allow inspectors to upload feedback photos related to parking violations.
- **Attendance Management:** Track and manage the attendance record of inspectors.

## How It Works

The Roadside Parking Management System utilizes magnetic sensors installed at parking spots and handheld PDA devices for real-time monitoring and management. Here's an overview of how the system works:

1. **User Experience:**
   - Users can view available parking spots on the map within the mini-app.
   - Upon entering a parking spot, the magnetic sensor sends a signal to the system, marking the spot as occupied.
   - Users need to scan a QR code within fifteen minutes to confirm their parking reservation.

2. **Inspector Intervention:**
   - If the user fails to scan the QR code, the inspector receives a warning message and takes necessary actions.

3. **Order Processing:**
   - Upon scanning the QR code, an order is created for the parking reservation.
   - When the car leaves the parking spot, the order automatically generates details and total fees for payment.

4. **Management System:**
   - The operational management system provides insights into user data, order information, parking spots, and inspector attendance records.
   - Administrators can use this information to make informed decisions about system operations and adjustments.

## Project Background

The Roadside Parking Management System addresses the growing need for efficient parking management in urban areas with limited parking space availability. By leveraging technology and hardware components like magnetic sensors and PDA devices, the system aims to streamline parking operations and improve user experience.
